'He won't hurt you,' said Frodo, hardly able to keep from laughing, although
he was himself startled and rather puzzled. 'He knows, as well as I do, that you
mean no harm. But just you up and answer his questions straight away!'
'Well, sir,' said Sam dithering a little. 'I heard a deal that I didn't
rightly understand, about an enemy, and rings, and Mr. Bilbo, sir, and dragons, and
a fiery mountain, and – and Elves, sir. I listened because I couldn't help myself,
if you know what I mean. Lor bless me, sir, but I do love tales of that sort. And I
believe them too, whatever Ted may say. Elves, sir! I would dearly love to see
them. Couldn't you take me to see Elves, sir, when you go?'
Suddenly Gandalf laughed. 'Come inside!' he shouted, and putting out both his
arms he lifted the astonished Sam, shears, grass-clippings and all, right through
the window and stood him on the floor. 'Take you to see Elves, eh?' he said, eyeing
Sam closely, but with a smile flickering on his face. 'So you heard that Mr. Frodo
is going away?'
'I did, sir. And that's why I choked: which you heard seemingly. I tried not
to, sir, but it burst out of me: I was so upset.'
'It can't be helped, Sam,' said Frodo sadly. He had suddenly realized that
flying from the Shire would mean more painful partings than merely saying farewell
to the familiar comforts of Bag End. 'I shall have to go. But' – and here he looked
hard at Sam – 'if you really care about me, you will keep that dead secret. See?
If you don't, if you even breathe a word of what you've heard here, then I hope
Gandalf will turn you into a spotted toad and fill the garden full of grass-snakes.'
