	Problem 5 6 7 - Code First\SocialNetwork.ConsoleClient\JsonResults

Steps... to victory!:
	Delete any previous PetStore or SocialNetwork databases from your Databases list

	Execute script or load the PetStore db from the .bak file
	Execute the stored procedure script and ensure that Color entries have been added - this will work only once
	Start Sample Data solution and wait a couple of seconds, check back in PetStore to ensure that there are enough entries
		(Number of entries may vary, but its usually around the asked for values)
	Execute the SQL queries to check their validity
	
	Start Code First solution, normally the initializer is set to drop and create the db each time, you can change that in the Context class
	After seeding the data from the xml files, jsons will start pouring out
	Ensure Jsons have been added by checking in the folder.
